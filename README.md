# Hoppy for Android

Hoppy is an Android application that I built. It is currently available as a free download from Google Play. 

Hoppy allows users to keep track of beers featured at beer events in Portland, Oregon. Often, beer events and festivals list their beers in print format, and few provide a forum for beer drinkers to rate beers, provide their thoughts, and add beers to their bucket lists.
